/**
 * Configuration how to confetti should be rendered
 * @property angle the direction the confetti will shoot
 * @property spread how wide the confetti will shoot in degrees. Use 1 to shoot in a straight line
 * and 360 to form a circle
 * @property speed The start speed of the confetti at the time of creation. Also set [maxSpeed] to
 * apply a random speed between speed and maxSpeed.
 * @property maxSpeed when [maxSpeed] is set a random speed between [speed] and [maxSpeed] will be
 * chosen. Using randomness creates a more natural and realistic look to the confetti when animating.
 * @property damping The rate at which the speed will decrease right after shooting the confetti
 * @property size The size of the confetti. Use: Size.SMALL, MEDIUM or LARGE for default sizes or
 * create your custom size using a new instance of [Size].
 * @property colors List of colors that will be randomly picked from
 * @property shapes Set the shape of the confetti. Set multiple shapes and it will be randomly
 * assigned upon creation of the confetti. See [Shape] for possible shapes and custom drawables.
 * @property timeToLive the amount of time in milliseconds before a particle will stop rendering
 * or fade out if [fadeOutEnabled] is set to true.
 * @property fadeOutEnabled If true and a confetti disappears because it ran out of time (set with timeToLive)
 * it will slowly fade out. If set to false it will instantly disappear from the screen.
 * @property fadeOutDuration the duration of the fade out effect, only used if [fadeOutEnabled] is set to true.
 * @property position the point where the confetti will spawn relative to the canvas. Use absolute
 * coordinates with [Position.Absolute] or relative coordinates between 0.0 and 1.0 using [Position.Relative].
 * Spawn confetti on random positions using [Position.Between].
 * @property delay the amount of milliseconds to wait before the rendering of the confetti starts
 * @property rotation enable the 3D rotation of a Confetti. See [Rotation] class for the configuration
 * options. Easily enable or disable it using [Rotation].enabled() or [Rotation].disabled() and
 * control the speed of rotations.
 * @property emitter instructions how many and often a confetti particle should spawn.
 * Use Emitter(duration, timeUnit).max(amount) or Emitter(duration, timeUnit).perSecond(amount) to
 * configure the Emitter.
